# SurfsUpProject
Repository holding the named projects files.

### Purpose

  The purpose of the project is to analysis, track, and compare weather conditions in June and December to determine the viability of a surf and ice-cream shop.

###Analysis

The results for weather conditions in June are shown below. There was an average temperature of 74.94 degrees, a minimum temperature of 64 degrees, and a max temperature of 85 degrees.

Next, the results for the weather conditions for December are depicted below. There is an average temperature of 71.04 degrees, a minimum temperature of 56 degrees, and a max     temperature of 83 degrees.

  What I noticed between the two tables was that the temperatures in December while lower, were not as low as I expected.

###Summary
  
  The overall results for weather conditions and the viability of opening a surf and ice-cream shop seem acceptable. Two additional queries to improve the results for this project   could be, calculating wind strengths and precipitation amounts.  Wind strength would determine the viability of surfing on windy days, and precipitation would also aid in that.
